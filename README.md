## Compilation

### CMake

Run the `configure.sh` file, with two supplied arguments:

```bash
./configure.sh {SERVER_IP} {SERVER_PORT}
```

Then, use CMake to compile the project:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

It will save the binaries in the `build` directory.

### Manual Compilation

Replace all IP Addresses and Ports in `src/server.c` and `src/backdoor.c` with your own.

Create a build directory:

```bash
mkdir build
```

Server:

```bash
gcc src/server.c -o build/server.exe -lws2_32
```

Backdoor:

```bash
gcc src/backdoor.c -o build/backdoor.exe -lws2_32 -lgdi32
```

## Usage

To run the server, simply execute bin/server.exe:

```bash
build/server.exe
```

And to run the backdoor, execute bin/backdoor.exe:

```bash
build/backdoor.exe
```
